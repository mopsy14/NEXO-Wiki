Getting Started
===============

## Things to know before starting
As in every minecraft mod, you should begin with mining essential early game ores (Titanium, Iron, Copper, Coal). Be carefull not to mine Uranium, as it is radioactive (it looks similar to coal).


## Step 1
First you will need a Furnace Generator, to generate electricity to power all machines.

## Step 2
Next you should craft the Crusher and the Press. With these machines you can make dusts and plates, which are crucial for progressing in the mod.

## Step 3
After that you should make a couple of Steel Ingots for the next steps. These ingots can be used for tools and machines. You can produce steel by putting Iron Ingots and Coal into the crusher to make their respective dusts. Combining these dusts in a crafting table will make Steel Dust, which you can put in a Blast Furnace to make steel ingots. Sometimes you will need Steel Plates, which you can make by putting the ingots in the press.

## Step 4
Since you've got Steel, you can optionally make an Electric Furnace as it can spare you a lot of fuel. 

## Step 5
It would also make your life a lot easier if you made the following items:  
- Fluid Pipes  
- Fluid Tanks  
- Pipe Wrench  
- Insulated Copper Cables  
- Makeshift Hazmat Armor  
- Portable Crafting Table  
- Decon Shower (and Drain)

Now that you've made a couple of basic machines, items and resources, you should be able to slowly work your way up to the goal of the mod: The (currently small) Nuclear Reactor.
